***Travelling Salesman Problem: An AI Approach***
Some code is from the most recent version of Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach's online repository. Using their defined object classes, I constructed a variation of the TSP using a randomly generated vector of points inside a 2-dimensional space. I then used several classical AI algorithms (and local search algorithms) for returning a solution -- a path through these cities -- with the smallest euclidean distance between them to traverse all cities and end up on the starting city (hamiltonian cycle). Featured algorithms include A*, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithms. Results were tested and measured in terms of runtime and accuracy. Key summary of results: A* works quickly for up to 10 cities, and drastically falls off after. Simulated Annealing and Hill Climbing are good at producing results for even tremendously large inputs, but suffer in terms of accuracy compared to A*. Genetic Algorithms experienced similar results to SA and HC, although I suspect that with proper parameter-tuning it can be made superior in terms of accuracy.
